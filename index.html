    <h2 style="background-color: rgb(228, 156, 89);text-align: center;"> Introduction </h2>
    <p> Food science is a discipline concerned with all aspects of food - beginning after harvesting, and ending with
        consumption by the consumer. It is considered one of the agricultural sciences, and it is a field which is
        entirely distinct from the field of nutrition. The field of food microbiology is a very broad one, encompassing
        the study of microorganisms which have both beneficial and deleterious effects on the quality and safety of raw
        and processed foods.It is important to understand the relationships among the various microorganisms making up
        the microflora of a food. Infact food microbiologists are concerned with the practical implications of the
        microflora of the food and the food microorganisms that can cause spoilage of food and disease in humans. The
        primary tool of microbiologists is the ability to identify and quantitate food-borne microorganisms. However,
        the inherent inaccuracies in enumeration processes, and the natural variation found in all bacterial populations
        complicate the microbiologist’s job. Moreover, they may be important from the aesthetic point of view. Of
        course, some useful bacteria may be important because they change the functional properties of food stuffs
        resulting in new tastes, odors or textures. Microorganisms in food include bacteria, molds, yeasts, algae,
        viruses, parasitic worms and protozoa. These organisms differ in size and shape and in their biochemical and
        cultural characteristics.</p>

    <li>Acinetobacter</li>
    Acinetobacter is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria.Acinetobacter species are
    non-motile and oxidase-negative, and occur in pairs as observed under magnification. Young cultures show rod shaped
    morphology. They are strict aerobes that do not reduce nitrates.

    <li> Bacillus cereus</li>
    B. cereus is a thick long rod shaped Gram positive, catalase positive aerobic spore former and the organism is
    important in food borne illness. It is a normal inhabitant of soil and is isolated from a variety of foods. It is
    quite often a cause of diarrheal illness due to the consumption of desserts, meat, dishes, dairy products, rice,
    pasta etc that are cooked and kept at room temperature as it is thermoduric. Some of the B. cereus strains are
    psychrotrophic as they grow at refrigeration temperature

    <li> Bacillus subtilis </li>
    Bacillus subtilis , known also as the hay bacillus or grass bacillus , is a Gram-positive, catalase-positive
    bacterium commonly found in soil. A member of the genus Bacillus, B. subtilis is thin short rod-shaped, and has the
    ability to form a tough, protective endospore, allowing the organism to tolerate extreme environmental conditions.
    B. subtilis produces the proteolytic enzyme subtilisin. B. subtilis spores can survive the extreme heat during
    cooking. B. subtilis is responsible for causing ropiness a sticky, stringy consistency caused by bacterial
    production of long-chain polysaccharides in spoiled bread dough. A strain of B. subtilis formerly known as Bacillus
    natto is used in the commercial production of the Japanese food natto, as well as the similar Korean food
    cheonggukjang. It is used to produce amylase and also used to produce hyaluronic acid, which is useful in the
    joint-care sector in healthcare.

    <li>Clostridium botulinum</li>
    C. botulinum produces the most potent toxin known. It is a Gram-positive anaerobic rod shaped bacterium. Oval
    endospores are formed in stationary phase cultures. There are seven types of C. botulinum (A to G) based on the
    serological specificity of the neurotoxin produced. Botulism is a rare but very serious disease. The ingestion of
    neurotoxin produced by the organism in foods can lead to death. However, the toxin (a protein) is easily inactivated
    by heat. The organism can grow at temperature ranging from 10-48 °C with optimum growth temperature at 37°C. Spores
    are highly heat resistant. The outgrowth of spores is inhibited at pH below 4.6, NaCl > 10% or water activity below
    0.94.
    Botulinum spores are probably the most radiation resistant spores of public health concern. Contamination of
    foods is through soil and sediments where they are commonly present. The organism grows under obligate
    anaerobic conditions and produces toxin in under processed (improper canning) low acid foods at ambient
    temperature.

    <li> Escherichia coli</li>
    E. coli strains are associated with food borne gastroenteritis. These are Gram-negative asprogeneous rods
    that ferment lactose and produce dark colonies with a metallic sheen on Endo agar. The organism grows well
    on a large number of media and in many foods. They grow over a wide range of temperature (4 to 46 °C ) and
    pH (4.4 to 9.0).However, they grow very slowly in foods held at refrigerator temp. (5 °C ). They belong to
    the family Enterobacteriaceae. The organism is also an indicator of fecal pollution. The organism is also capable of
    producing acid and gas and off-flavours in foods. E. coli strains involved in foodborne-illness can be
    placed into five groups: enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC),
    enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) and facultatively enteropathogenic (FEEC).
    The organism also grows in the presence of bile salts. The primary habitat of E.coli is the intestinal tract
    of most warm blooded animals. E.coli 0157: H7 strains are unusually tolerant of acidic environments.

    <li> Listeria monocytogenes </li>
    Listeria monocytogenes in foods has attracted worldwide attention due to the serious illness it causes in
    human beings. The Listeria are Gram positive non spore forming, nonacid-fast rods. The organism is catalase
    positive and produces lactic acid from glucose and other fermentable sugars. The organism grows well in
    brain heart infusion (BHI), trypticase soy, and tryptose broths. However, the medium should be fortified
    with B. vitamins and the amino acids. It is a mesophilic organism with optimal growth temperature 37°C but
    it can grow at refrigerator temperature also. Strains grows over the temperature range of 1°C to 45°C and pH
    range 4.1 to 9.6.

    <li> Salmonella </li>
    almonella spp. have been reported to be a leading cause of foodborne illnesses in humans. Foodborne salmonellosis
    scores over all other foodborne bacterial illnesses in humans. Enteric fever is a serious human disease associated
    with typhoid and paratyphoid strains. SalmonellaEnterobacteriaceae. The optimum growth temperature is 37-45 °C. The
    organism can also grow at about 7°C in foods. I t ferments carbohydrates with its production of acid and gas.
    Salmonella are oxidase negative, catalase positive and grow on citrate as a sole carbon source and produce H2S. Some
    Salmonella strains can grow at higher temperatures (54 °C) while others exhibit psychrotrophic properties. The
    organism has the ability to grow at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 9.5, with an optimum pH growth at 6.5 to 7.5. spp.
    are facultatively anaerobic, small Gram-negative, non spore forming, rod-shaped (2-4 m m) bacteria
